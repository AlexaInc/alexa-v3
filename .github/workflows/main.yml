    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js (version 20 in this case)

        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies for your application
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install

      # Step 4: Install system-level dependencies (e.g., ffmpeg, speedtest-cli)
      - name: Install system dependencies
        run: |
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install -y software-properties-common speedtest-cli ffmpeg

      # Uncomment the following if you want to run tests
      # - name: Run tests
      #   run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build  # This makes the deployment job run after the build job

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository (again for deployment job)
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Deploy your app (example runs npm start on the runner)
      - name: Start application
        run: |
          # Navigate to the app directory (if necessary)
          cd /path/to/your/app

          # Install any new dependencies (in case something changed in package.json)
          npm install

          # Start the application
          npm start
          
          # You can also use pm2 or another process manager if needed
          # pm2 start app.js --name "your-app-name"
