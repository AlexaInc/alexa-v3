Ookla Speedtest™ Web SDK
========================

## Overview

Built in JavaScript, the Web SDK allows you to install Speedtest as the testing solution on your website. You can build the user interface to your exact specifications, configure individual test stages, and test against either the public Speedtest Server Network or your own private servers.

Test result data can be surfaced in your web application, saved to your own datastore by your webserver, or delivered to you via an Ookla-enriched extract or a real-time feed. Available data elements include

* performance information (download speed, upload speed, latency, jitter)
* connection information (server name, server country, ISP, IP address)
* location information (latitude, longitude, server location, distance to server, location name)

(This list is not exhaustive, and the data may differ between different delivery methods.)

## Getting Started

To use the Web SDK, you will need to [purchase a license from Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/inquire).

Documentation is distributed separately, alongside a sample app that demonstrates the SDK's functionality in a browser.
